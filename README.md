##About
This fork buids on vivek1794's WebRTC Android codelab. I have fixed some minor issues and bugs with the code, especially in the signalling server code. I have also migrated Step 3 of the codelab (the finished app) to androidx. I have also updated the code to work with the new Xirsys ICE server framework. The quickstart for the project also includes a guide to host the signalling server code on Heroko. Along with the ICE servers, this allows the app to work with the two phones running the app on separate networks, in distant locations. I have added a demo of using the DataChannel to send or receive messages. You can find details about how to use the DataChannel below. The ScreenCaptureActivity adds screen sharing support using the ScreenCapturerAndroid class.
